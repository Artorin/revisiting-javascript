# Contributing to revisiting_javascript

Welcome Aboard Mate 🎉

## Things to work on
- Check if there is an issue that you'd like to work on.
- Create a feature request.
- Report a Bug.

⭐⭐ Add your **contact info (Discord, Twitter, Instagram etc.)** to pull request.

## Rules
- Use camel-case 🐫 for naming the files. E.g. linearSearch.js, heapSort.js
- Do not use dependencies.
- Use ***[Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)*** standard.
  - Here is the VS Code extension [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits)
  - Commit message examples
    - **New Feature** - feat: ✨ added *[description of feature]*.
    - **Fix Bug** - fix: 🐛 fixed *[description of bug]*
- Add a comment to the top of the file with the name of the feature, and some helpful resources (or resources that you've used) for that feature. Use [this file](https://github.com/captainAyan/revisiting_javascript/blob/main/functional/immutability.js) as an example.
- Write comments to describe what you're doing.
- Add an inline comment to show the output of an `console.log` statement. E.g. `console.log(p); // Output: [ 'val1' ]`
- Run `npm run pretty` to prettify the code. **(make sure that you have dev dependencies installed)**

😅 I think that's all you need to know in order to get started. Message me on discord at **CaptainAyan#5716** for any questions.
